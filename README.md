# tiger-hash

This is a basic Tiger-Hash algorithm as in the paper 'Tiger: A Fast New Hash Function' written by Ross Anderson and Eli Biham.

A Basic NCurses interface will be made in order to make it user-friendly.

The project is dependant on dynamically linked 'ncurses' library, and can be compiled into the 'bin' directory using the MakeFile.
